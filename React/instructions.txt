TO RUN:
Download calculator folder.
cd to folder, and run npm start in terminal.

*Note: Can ignore python and csv files in repo. Although functional, implementation was changed and
they are no longer used.


CATALOG:
Click on Items in the catalog to add to cart. Clicking an item already in the cart will increment 
the quantity in cart.

Four preset items are placed in the catalog for you, but feel free to create new items. 
Place an item name and price into the corresponding text fields and click Create Item to add it 
to the catalog. If the item name you typed matches that of an item already in the catalog, its price 
will be updated to the new one you placed.

The catalog has a size limit of 9, so subsequent creations past limit will overwrite entries in the 
catalog.

*Note: Create Item will only work given valid input, such as a string for name and numerical value 
above 0 for price.

SHOPPING CART:
Items added to cart will appear here. Items can be incremented and decremented with the corresponding 
+ and - buttons. Pressing - when quantity is 1 will remove the item from cart. The cart has a limit of
6 for unique items, so remove items to add new items to cart. Bags can also be added to purchase for 
5 cents each.

Use code "discount30" to apply a 30% off discount to purchase. Subsequent items added to cart will 
have the discount automatically applied to them. Other code attempts will do nothing to subtotal.

Pressing Checkout will reset the cart to empty, and the most recent transaction will be saved in 
browser memory.

Pressing Past Transaction will fill the cart with items from the previous purchase and display the 
subtotal and total. Adding to cart and incrementing is disabled while viewing last transaction, so 
press Past Transaction again to reset cart.
